## Day 1: Introduction to Multithreading in Java

### 🧠 Objective
Understand the difference between **processes and threads**, the **benefits of multithreading**, and create a basic Java program that prints numbers using **two threads**.

---

### 🔍 Key Concepts
- A **process** is an independent unit of execution with its own memory space.
- A **thread** is a lightweight unit within a process that shares the same memory.

#### ✅ Benefits of Multithreading
- Better CPU utilization
- Improved application responsiveness
- Faster execution via concurrency
- Useful for background tasks (e.g., animations, loading)

---

### 💡 Real-life Analogy
Imagine a restaurant (process):
- One waiter (thread) takes orders
- Another waiter (thread) serves food
They operate independently but share the same kitchen (memory).

### 🛠️ Code: Print Numbers Using Two Threads
```java
public class NumberPrinter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // First thread prints even numbers
        Thread evenThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
                    System.out.println("Even: " + i);
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(100); // simulate work
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
        });

        // Second thread prints odd numbers
        Thread oddThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i += 2) {
                    System.out.println("Odd: " + i);
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(100);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
        });

        evenThread.start();
        oddThread.start();
    }
}
```

### 🎯 Summary
- Multithreading enables concurrent execution
- Threads share memory and CPU
- Created threads using `Runnable` interface

---

### 🧪 Task
Try modifying the range from 0–10 to 0–100. Observe how the outputs mix.

### 📘 What's Next
Tomorrow we'll explore how to **create threads using the Thread class** vs **Runnable interface**.
